======================================

A comprehensive understanding of how genetic variation causes phenotypic 
variation of a complex trait is a long-term disciplinary goal of genetics. The 
basic premise is that in a well-validated model that is capable of accounting 
for the phenotypic variation in a population, the causative genetic variation 
will manifest in the model parameters. In this context, the term "phenotype" 
refers to any relevant measure of model behaviour, whereas the term 
"parameter" denotes a quantity that is constant over the time-scale of the 
particular model being studied. However, even the lowest-level model 
parameters are themselves phenotypes :doi:`<10.1534/genetics.108.087064>`, 
whose genetic basis may be mono-, oligo- or polygenic, and whose physiological 
basis can be mechanistically modelled at ever deeper levels of detail. The 
term causally cohesive genotype-phenotype (cGP) modeling (43) thus denotes an 
approach where low-level parameters have an articulated relationship to the 
individual's genotype, and higher-level phenotypes emerge from the 
mathematical model describing the causal dynamic relationships between these 
lower-level processes. It aims to bridge the gap between standard population 
genetic models that simply assign phenotypic values directly to genotypes, and 
mechanistic physiological models without an explicit genetic basis. This 
forces a causally coherent depiction of the genotype-to-phenotype (GP) map.
